# Learning Foreign Languages project
A webapp to learn relevant vocabularies in a foreign language that are specific to each user's occupation tag(s). This repo is for the prototype.

Basic user structure implemented at [Peck](https://peck.herokuapp.com). Membership capability available (email confirmation with SendGrid). Material not yet loaded. Waiting for frontend to beautify.
